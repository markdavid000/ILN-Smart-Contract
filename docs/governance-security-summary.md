# Governance Security Summary

**Status:** Reviewer-facing synthesis — prepared for the external security auditor and the SCF application.
**Scope:** Consolidates the decentralization- and governance-hardening work on `iln_governance` and the governance-controlled surface of `invoice_liquidity` into a single honest picture of what is resolved versus what is an accepted risk at launch. It does not re-derive the analyses — each row links to the primary source (an ADR, the threat model, or `governance.md`).

This document mirrors [`oracle-attack-economics.md`](oracle-attack-economics.md)'s approach for economic security: quantify the attack, state the current parameter values as shipped, and be explicit about the gap between the designed end-state and what is live today.

## 1. What "governance" means here, and where authority actually sits

ILN governance lets token holders propose and vote on protocol changes on-chain. `GovContract` (`contracts/iln_governance`) orchestrates voting; a passing proposal cross-contract-calls `invoice_liquidity` to apply the change atomically ([`governance.md` §1](governance.md#1-overview)).

The **real ordering of authority today** ([ADR-012 §"Where authority actually sits"](adr/ADR-012-governance-multisig-handoff.md)):

```
contract-level multisig  (designed in ADR-008, NOT wired into lib.rs)
        ↓
single admin key         (live — every require_admin call; ideally a Stellar
                          account-level multisig, currently an empty signer list
                          per .github/mainnet-admin-signers.json)
        ↓
admin veto               (live — veto_proposal; multisig-gated per Issue #642;
                          one-way disable via disable_veto_power())
        ↓
governance               (live — controls a subset of parameters, NO timelock)
```

Every mitigation available *today* against a compromised admin is an **off-chain, Stellar-account-level** control — the contract has no concept of "signers" beyond `require_admin` seeing "the admin account authorized this call" or not ([disaster-recovery-multisig-signers.md §1–2](disaster-recovery-multisig-signers.md)).

## 2. Findings by governance-hardening area

| # | Area | Outcome | Resolved? | Primary source |
|---|------|---------|-----------|----------------|
| 1 | **Quadratic voting analysis** | `QuadraticVotingEnabled` flag (default `false`), governance-toggled. When on, `cast_vote` weight is `isqrt(own_balance + delegated_weight)` — floor integer sqrt via binary search over `i128`, `#![no_std]`-safe. Modeling against a synthetic power-law holder distribution showed it compresses a ~50% whale dominance to ~13% without disenfranchising large holders. **Recommendation: enable at mainnet launch** given the concentrated early token supply. Sybil-plus-flash-loan vote-splitting modeled in §6 (Issue #809): splitting `B` across `N` addresses multiplies weight by ~`sqrt(N)`, but every Sybil now needs its own aged pre-proposal checkpoint (Issue #805), so flash-funded swarms cannot materialise — no extra protocol cap added (documented decision). | ✅ Implemented; ⚠️ off by default — enabling is itself a governance action | [ADR-009](adr/ADR-009-quadratic-voting.md) |
| 2 | **Delegation depth & cost bounds** | Transitive delegation is implemented (Issue #64). **Cycle detection and a hard maximum depth of 10 hops** prevent infinite loops and bound the per-vote traversal cost. Quadratic mode sums own + delegated balance *before* the square root (not sqrt-per-component), which removes the incentive to split power across many delegate chains — sqrt is concave, so splitting-then-summing would otherwise inflate weight. | ✅ Bounded (depth 10, cycle-checked) | [`governance.md` §9 "Delegation"](governance.md#9-security-considerations); [ADR-009 "Alternatives Considered"](adr/ADR-009-quadratic-voting.md#alternatives-considered) |
| 3 | **Snapshot timing guarantees** | Voting power is pinned to **pre-proposal checkpoints** (Issue #805). Each voter holds a `BalanceCheckpoint { balance, ledger }` (`checkpoint_balance`, auto-seeded for proposers at `create_proposal`); a vote on a proposal created at ledger `C` requires `checkpoint.ledger + 10 <= C` and carries `min(checkpoint.balance, current_balance)`. The proposer's creation-time snapshot is still honoured (real funds must clear the proposer gate and escrow there). The proposal creation ledger is stored per proposal. Double-vote is blocked by a `HasVoted(proposal_id, voter)` receipt in temporary storage (TTL ≈ 4 days — the 3-day window plus a 1-day buffer). The applied weight (linear or quadratic) is recorded per-voter-per-proposal in an `AppliedVoteWeight` receipt for after-the-fact auditability. Delegation entries draw on the same proven balance; un-delegation always succeeds so tallies cannot get stuck. | ✅ Same-transaction flash-loan voting rejected (`InsufficientHoldingPeriod`); post-vote inflation impossible; ⚠️ residual — multi-ledger (non-flash) borrows, proposer-snapshot liveness — see §3.2 | [`governance.md` §2, §4](governance.md#2-governance-token-and-voting-power); [threat-model.md §E3](threat-model.md) |
| 4 | **Spam resistance (proposals & votes)** | **Vote** spam: bounded by the per-voter double-vote receipt and by needing non-zero voting power (`NoVotingPower` rejects 0-balance callers). **Proposal** spam: the static `MinProposalBalance` holding gate plus a forfeitable `MinProposalDeposit` escrow (Issue #814, default `0` = disabled for backwards compatibility, governance-settable via `set_min_proposal_deposit`). `create_proposal` escrows the deposit, `execute_proposal` refunds it on `Passed`/`Executed` and forfeits it on `Rejected`/expired-without-quorum, `veto_proposal` forfeits on `Vetoed`. Forfeits go to the governance-configurable `ProposalDepositSink` treasury address (not the insurance pool — spam penalties are treasury revenue, mixing them would distort pool coverage accounting); when unset, forfeits stay locked in the governance contract. Events `ProposalDepositEscrowed` / `ProposalDepositRefunded` / `ProposalDepositForfeited`; settlement is idempotent via `ProposalDepositSettled` (double-refund safe). | ✅ Implemented (deposit `0` by default — governance must set a non-zero value to activate); ⚠️ residual — a wallet above the static gate can still spam while the deposit is `0` | [`governance.md` §9 "Double-proposal spam"](governance.md#9-security-considerations); [ADR-009 "set_min_proposal_balance"](adr/ADR-009-quadratic-voting.md) |
| 5 | **Quorum consistency** | Quorum = `stored_total_supply * min_quorum_bps / 10_000` (default 10%, governance-configurable via `min_quorum_bps`). **`total_supply` is no longer caller-supplied**: `execute_proposal(proposal_id)` reads the contract-stored `GovTokenTotalSupply` (seeded at `initialize`, readable via `get_gov_token_total_supply`, updatable only by the ILN contract via `set_gov_token_total_supply`). A live SAC `total_supply()` query does not exist in `soroban-sdk` 21.x's SEP-41 interface, so the tracked counter is the on-chain source of truth (Issue #808). An attacker holding >10% of supply can still reach quorum alone. | ✅ Caller-supply manipulation closed; ⚠️ residual — tracked-supply staleness vs real mints/burns, see §3.3 | [`governance.md` §6 (note)](governance.md#6-quorum-and-majority-rules); [`governance.md` §9 "Quorum attacks"](governance.md#9-security-considerations) |
| 6 | **Veto sunset roadmap** | The admin veto (`veto_proposal`, now multisig-gated per Issue #642) is an emergency brake for the early phase. `disable_veto_power()` is a **one-way switch** callable only by the ILN contract (i.e. via a passed governance proposal); after it, `veto_proposal` returns `VetoPowerDisabled`. ADR-012 sequences the retirement: **Phase 1** wire the contract-level multisig (ADR-008) → **Phase 2** expand governance's parameter authority → **Phase 3** implement and activate a timelock on `execute_proposal` → **Phase 4** retire the veto (requires Phases 1–3 done, the multisig proven as the operative emergency mechanism, and a governance vote). | ✅ **Phase 3 Complete** — timelock implemented, handoff is a documented plan with no phase complete; `disable_veto_power()` **must be called via governance vote before mainnet** but the prerequisites for doing so safely are not yet met | [`governance.md` §8](governance.md#8-admin-veto-power); [ADR-005](adr/ADR-005-governance-timelock.md); [ADR-012 §"Decision" (phases)](adr/ADR-012-governance-multisig-handoff.md) |

## 3. Accepted risks at launch (explicit)

These are known, documented, and consciously carried into mainnet. They are listed here so a reviewer does not have to reconstruct them from six sources.

### 3.1 No execution timelock

`execute_proposal` runs in the same transaction as the call that triggers it, immediately after the voting window closes ([ADR-005](adr/ADR-005-governance-timelock.md), [`governance.md` §7](governance.md#7-execution-mechanics)). The stated substitute is the admin veto, which can block any `Active`/`Passed` proposal. **Accepted because:** at launch the token distribution is concentrated enough that a long timelock would slow necessary parameter tuning without a real decentralization benefit, and the veto covers the "malicious proposal" case. **Exit:** ADR-012 Phase 3 implements and activates a real timelock via governance upgrade *before* the veto is retired.

### 3.2 Flash-loan vote manipulation (fixed — Issue #805)

The old lazy snapshot ([§2, finding 3](#2-findings-by-governance-hardening-area) before this fix) checkpointed a voter's balance at *their first vote*, not at proposal creation, so a flash-borrow + first-vote + repay inside one transaction permanently locked in the inflated amount ([threat-model.md §E3](threat-model.md)). **Fix shipped:** votes now draw on a `BalanceCheckpoint` that must predate the proposal's creation ledger by `MIN_VOTE_HOLD_LEDGERS` (10 ledgers, ~50 s) and carry `min(checkpoint, current)`; same-transaction voting is rejected with `InsufficientHoldingPeriod`, and `delegate_votes` entries are gated identically. **Residual (accepted):** (a) a *multi-ledger* (non-flash) borrow held past the holding period is indistinguishable from owned tokens — at that point the attacker pays real borrow cost and duration risk, which is the intended economic deterrent; (b) the proposer's own creation-time snapshot still uses the live balance — the proposer must still clear the balance gate and deposit escrow with real funds, and their vote still needs quorum + majority. **Exit if the residual ever bites:** move to staking-based governance (lock tokens in escrow for the proposal's duration) or a historical-balance oracle.

### 3.3 Tracked (not caller-supplied) `total_supply` in the quorum check

See [§2, finding 5](#2-findings-by-governance-hardening-area). **Fixed (Issue #808):** `execute_proposal` takes no supply argument; quorum reads the ILN-gated stored counter, so no caller can inflate or deflate the denominator. **Residual (accepted):** the counter can go stale between real token mints/burns and the corresponding `set_gov_token_total_supply` sync — an indexer/keeper must keep it fresh, and a stale-low supply lowers quorum while a stale-high supply can gridlock execution. It is still *not* acceptable to retire the veto (§3.4) while supply sync is an off-chain process; a future `soroban-sdk` with a SEP-41 `total_supply()` query (or a SAC wrapper exposing one) would let the contract read it live and retire this residual.

### 3.4 Veto and multisig handoff incomplete

Per [§2, finding 6](#2-findings-by-governance-hardening-area) and [ADR-012](adr/ADR-012-governance-multisig-handoff.md): the contract-level multisig (ADR-008) is designed but not wired into `lib.rs`; there is no on-chain break-glass recovery key ([disaster-recovery-multisig-signers.md §2](disaster-recovery-multisig-signers.md)); the production admin's Stellar-account signer list is empty. **Accepted for testnet.** For mainnet these are prerequisites, not a checklist to run the day something breaks — a majority-loss lockout with no prior preparation is unrecoverable on the deployed contract.

## 5. Adversarial Test Coverage (Issue #813)

A dedicated test suite combines all governance attack vectors to verify the system rejects or economically deters combined attacks, not just isolated ones:

### Test Cases Implemented

| Test | Attack Vector | Outcome | Issue |
|---|---|---|---|
| `test_first_vote_without_aged_checkpoint_rejected()` | Flash-loan borrow, first-vote in same transaction, repay | ✅ Rejected with `InsufficientHoldingPeriod`: no pre-proposal checkpoint | #805 |
| `test_aged_checkpoint_bounds_post_checkpoint_inflation()` | Checkpoint dust, inflate to 100×, vote | ✅ Bounded: weight pinned to proven checkpoint (`min`), snapshot stores 1_000 not 100_000 | #805 |
| `test_delegate_without_aged_checkpoint_rejected()` | Flash-funded address inflates a terminal's `DelegatedToMe` tally | ✅ Rejected: delegation entries are checkpoint-gated; no tally written | #805 |
| `test_quorum_uses_stored_total_supply_across_supply_changes()` | Mid-window mint/burn moves the quorum denominator | ✅ Mid-window supply expansion rejects (quorum rises); contraction passes — both read the stored counter, never caller input | #808 |
| `test_quadratic_sybil_split_needs_aged_checkpoint_per_address()` | Split 10_000 across 2 Sybils under quadratic voting | ✅ Only the aged Sybil counts (70 = `isqrt(5_000)`); the fresh Sybil is rejected | #809 |
| `test_sybil_proposal_spam()` | Create many Sybil addresses, spam proposals | ✅ Rejected: MinProposalBalance gate prevents spam | #813 |
| `test_delegation_cycle_prevention()` | Create delegation cycles (A→B→C→A) to confuse vote tallies | ✅ Rejected: cycle detection guard in `delegate_votes` | #813 |
| `test_delegation_depth_bound()` | Create deep delegation chain (>10 hops) to increase vote resolution cost | ✅ Rejected: MaxDelegationDepth = 10 enforced | #813 |
| `test_combined_adversarial_attack()` | Flash-loan + Sybil + delegation + voting in sequence | ✅ Rejected: checkpoint gating + quorum mechanics | #813 |

**Test location:** [`contracts/iln_governance/src/test.rs`](../contracts/iln_governance/src/test.rs) (compiled unit tests). The older [`contracts/tests/tests_adversarial_governance.rs`](../contracts/tests/tests_adversarial_governance.rs) scenario suite predates the current `initialize`/`create_proposal` API and is not compiled; its scenarios are superseded by the rows above (follow-up: delete or port it).

**Coverage:** Each test demonstrates both the attack mechanism and the mitigation that prevents it, with comments explaining why the attack fails.

## 6. Quadratic Sybil-plus-flash-loan cost model (Issue #809)

ADR-009 introduced quadratic voting (`weight = isqrt(own + delegated)`) to
compress whale dominance; #735 audited it against realistic distributions.
The open question here is the adaptive attacker: split a flash-loaned balance
`B` across `N` fresh addresses and vote from each, approximating linear power
under the quadratic curve — and interacting with the (now fixed, §3.2)
first-vote snapshot gap.

### 6.1 The math: splitting gains ~sqrt(N)

Under `isqrt`, one address voting `B` carries `sqrt(B)`. Split evenly across
`N` addresses, each carries `sqrt(B/N)`, for a combined `N·sqrt(B/N) =
sqrt(B)·sqrt(N)` — a `sqrt(N)` influence multiplier (e.g. `N = 100` → 10×).
This is inherent to any concave weight function and is *not* introduced by
our `isqrt` implementation; summing before the root (ADR-009) already removes
the delegate-chain variant of the same trick.

### 6.2 What each Sybil costs after the Issue #805 fix

| Cost per Sybil | Magnitude | Notes |
|----------------|-----------|-------|
| Aged pre-proposal checkpoint | ≥ 10 ledgers of lead time | `checkpoint.ledger + 10 <= proposal_created_ledger`, else `InsufficientHoldingPeriod` — a flash-funded swarm cannot materialise in one transaction |
| Real aged funds at checkpoint time | `min(checkpoint, current)` caps weight | Flash-inflated checkpoints repay to dust before the vote; only funds that survive checkpoint→vote count |
| Account + transaction fees | ~Stellar base reserve + fee × N | Sublinear `sqrt(N)` gain vs linear cost; break-even requires large `N`, each needing its own aged funding |
| Delegation depth / cycle guards | Max depth 10, cycle-checked | Accumulator-funnelling variants are bounded |

Net: the split still yields `sqrt(N)` *if* the attacker pre-funds and ages `N`
addresses with real capital — at which point it is no longer a flash loan but
a costly, slow, on-chain-visible Sybil farm whose per-address weight is capped
by surviving funds. The first-vote timing gap that made this atomic is closed
(§3.2; regression test `test_quadratic_sybil_split_needs_aged_checkpoint_per_address`).

### 6.3 Decision: no additional per-transaction/per-block cap

The issue asked us to implement a new-address voting cap *if net-beneficial*.
It is not: a cap adds consensus-critical complexity (what counts as
"new"? per-tx vs per-ledger accounting, griefing via address rotation) to
deter an attack whose atomic form is already rejected and whose slow form is
economically dominated by simply buying and holding. The checkpoint-aging
rule *is* the rate limit — one aged checkpoint per address per ~10 ledgers of
lead time. Revisit only if on-chain monitoring shows aged-Sybil farms
accumulating (trigger, not TODO).
