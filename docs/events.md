# ILN Smart Contract Event Schema

## Overview

This document is the result of a full event-emission completeness audit
(Issue #538): every state-changing (storage-mutating) function across all
five contracts was mapped and checked for event coverage. Gaps found during
the audit have been fixed in the same change that produced this document —
see "Audit summary" below for what was added and why.

Events are consumed by indexers, blockchain explorers, and off-chain backend
integrations as the audit trail for on-chain state transitions. Indexers
should reconstruct state from these events rather than scraping ledger
entries directly.

## Audit summary

| Contract | Function | Before | Fix |
| -------- | -------- | ------ | --- |
| `invoice_liquidity` | `initialize` | No event | Added `ContractInitialized` |
| `invoice_liquidity` | `set_distribution_contract` | No event | Added `DistributionContractUpdated` |
| `invoice_liquidity` | `set_price_oracle` | No event | Added `PriceOracleUpdated` |
| `invoice_liquidity` | `set_max_oracle_age` | No event | Reused `ParameterUpdated` |
| `insurance_pool` | `initialize` | No event | Added inline `init` event (coverage cap) |
| `reputation_bonus` | `init` | No event | Added `ContractInitialized` |
| `reputation_bonus` | `set_config` (raw setter, distinct from `update_config`) | No event | Added `ConfigSet` |
| `reputation_bonus` | `submit_invoice` | No event | Added `InvoiceSubmitted` |
| `reputation_bonus` | `mark_paid` | No event | Added `InvoiceStatusChanged` |
| `reputation_bonus` | `handle_default` | No event | Added `InvoiceStatusChanged` |
| `iln_distribution` | `initialize` | No event | Added `ContractInitialized` |
| `iln_distribution` | `accrue_lp` | No event | Added `LpVolumeAccrued` |
| `iln_distribution` | `accrue_settlement` | No event | Added `SettlementAccrued` |
| `iln_distribution` | `claim_tokens` | No event | Added `TokensClaimed` |
| `iln_governance` | `initialize` | No event | Added `GovernanceInitialized` |

All other state-changing functions across all five contracts already emitted
events prior to this audit (verified function-by-function; see per-contract
sections below for the full inventory, including functions that were
correctly found to need no event because they are pure read-only views).

Two events referenced by a stale prior version of this document —
`ContractPaused`/`ContractUnpaused` "missing struct" and `TokenAdded`/
`TokenRemoved`/`InvoiceExpired`/`InvoiceDisputed`/`ReputationUpdated`/
`LPPositionTransferred` "not emitted" — were already fully implemented in
the code by the time of this audit; the document had simply not been kept in
sync with the contract. This rewrite corrects that drift for all five
contracts and should be kept current going forward.

## Automated Coverage Check (Issue #858)

This document is now machine-checked. `scripts/check-event-coverage.ts`
parses every `#[contractimpl]` entrypoint across the five contracts,
classifies each as state-mutating or read-only, and verifies that every
mutating entrypoint either publishes an event (directly or through an
`emit_*`/publish helper) or carries a documented exemption:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/check-event-coverage.ts --check    # exit 1 on drift (also: make event-coverage)
npx tsx scripts/check-event-coverage.ts --report   # full contract/function matrix
npx tsx --test scripts/check-event-coverage.test.ts # classifier unit tests
```

CI runs the unit tests and the `--check` gate on every PR touching
`contracts/**` (`.github/workflows/event-coverage.yml`), so this document
cannot silently drift from the code again: when a new mutating entrypoint
ships without an event, the build fails until the event, the exemption, or
the docs are updated together.

## Known Gaps — Accepted Non-Emitting Mutators

These state-mutating entrypoints intentionally publish no event. Each row
mirrors the `EXEMPTIONS` table in `scripts/check-event-coverage.ts`; the CI
check fails if a row exists in one place but not the other.

| Function | Reason |
| -------- | ------ |
| `invoice_liquidity::initialize_multisig_admin` | One-shot multisig bootstrap (signer set + threshold). Writes only multisig config storage; every subsequent state change made through the multisig (pause/unpause/token removal/fee changes/signer rotation) emits its own event from execute_proposal, so the bootstrap itself adds no new observable state transition worth an event. |
| `invoice_liquidity::propose_pause` | Multisig proposal bookkeeping only (stores a pending proposal). The effect becomes observable when execute_proposal applies it and emits ContractPaused; proposal creation is signer-gated and reversible via the proposal expiry path. |
| `invoice_liquidity::propose_unpause` | Multisig proposal bookkeeping only; observable effect is the ContractUnpaused event emitted by execute_proposal. |
| `invoice_liquidity::propose_remove_token` | Multisig proposal bookkeeping only; observable effect is the TokenRemoved event emitted by execute_proposal. |
| `invoice_liquidity::propose_set_fee_rate` | Multisig proposal bookkeeping only; observable effect is the ParameterUpdated event emitted by execute_proposal. |
| `invoice_liquidity::propose_set_max_discount` | Multisig proposal bookkeeping only; observable effect is the ParameterUpdated event emitted by execute_proposal. |
| `invoice_liquidity::propose_update_multisig` | Multisig proposal bookkeeping only; signer-set changes are applied silently by execute_proposal and are readable via get_multisig_admin (accepted gap — no dedicated event for signer-set changes). |
| `invoice_liquidity::propose_rotate_signer` | Multisig proposal bookkeeping only; observable effect is the SignerRotationScheduled event emitted by execute_proposal. |
| `invoice_liquidity::sign_proposal` | Records a signer's approval on a pending multisig proposal (per-proposal signature counter). Effect is signer-gated, reversible until threshold, and observable via the event emitted when the proposal executes. |
| `invoice_liquidity::record_twap_sample` | High-frequency keeper operation (Issue #859 rate-limit exemption): a single sample is transient accumulator input, not a discrete state transition — the aggregate effect is observable through the price reads it feeds (and PriceOutlierRejected on outlier handling). |
| `invoice_liquidity::set_insurance_pool` | Admin-gated, rate-limited pointer swap; the new address is immediately readable via get_insurance_pool, and every subsequent claim flow references the pool through its own events (InsuranceClaimAttempted) — accepted gap, no dedicated event. |
| `invoice_liquidity::set_max_price_deviation_bps` | Admin-gated oracle tuning knob (rate-limited); the threshold only materializes on the next price read, whose PriceOutlierRejected events expose its effect. Readable via get_max_price_deviation_bps. |
| `invoice_liquidity::set_twap_enabled` | Admin-gated per-feed TWAP opt-in flag (rate-limited); changes how subsequent Price reads are computed rather than marking a discrete transition. Readable via is_twap_enabled. |
| `invoice_liquidity::set_twap_window` | Admin-gated TWAP window bound (rate-limited, range-validated); affects subsequent windowed reads only. Readable via get_twap_window_ledgers. |
| `iln_governance::set_proposal_deposit_sink` | Admin-gated treasury pointer on the governance contract (separate admin gate, no shared rate-limit infra in that crate — Issue #859 matrix); readable via get_proposal_deposit_sink and only consulted during proposal lifecycle events that emit their own audit trail. |
| `insurance_pool::increment_default_count` | Internal bookkeeping counter updated as a side effect of default processing; per-pair state is exposed by the pair views and surfaced again by claim/payout events — no independent transition to announce. |
| `insurance_pool::set_base_premium_rate_bps` | Admin-gated premium tuning on the insurance pool (admin gate; Issue #859 matrix); applies to future enrollments only with no retroactive effect. Readable via get_base_premium_rate_bps. |
| `insurance_pool::set_risk_multiplier` | Admin-gated pricing multiplier on the insurance pool (admin gate; Issue #859 matrix); applies to future enrollments only. Readable via get_risk_multiplier_numerator/denominator. |

## `reputation_bonus`

| Function | Event coverage |
| -------- | --------------- |
| `init` | ✅ `ContractInitialized` (added by this audit) |
| `set_config` | ✅ `ConfigSet` (added by this audit) |
| `update_config` | ✅ `ParameterUpdated` ×3 (one per changed field — pre-existing) |
| `submit_invoice` | ✅ `InvoiceSubmitted` (added by this audit) |
| `mark_paid` | ✅ `InvoiceStatusChanged` (added by this audit) |
| `handle_default` | ✅ `InvoiceStatusChanged` (added by this audit) |
| `get_config` / `get_reputation` | 🔍 read-only views |

`update_config` and `set_config` both write to the same underlying storage
key but are kept as separate entrypoints with separate events:
`update_config` is the fine-grained, per-field audited path (three
`ParameterUpdated` events, one per field, each carrying the old and new
value), while `set_config` is a bulk replace that emits a single `ConfigSet`
snapshot of the whole config. Note: `set_config` currently has no admin
auth check in `lib.rs` — this is a pre-existing access-control gap, outside
the scope of this event-emission audit, and should be tracked separately.

## Indexer Notes

* **Event Ordering Assumptions**: In `invoice_liquidity`, `InvoiceSubmitted`
  always precedes `InvoiceFunded`, which precedes `InvoicePaid` or
  `InvoiceDefaulted`.
* **State Reconstruction**: `InvoiceSubmitted`/`ContractInitialized`/
  `GovernanceInitialized` include a `timestamp` field specifically so
  indexers can reconstruct creation time without querying ledger headers.
* **Timestamps**: All timestamps are `u64` seconds since the Unix epoch.
* **Amounts**: All numeric amounts (`amount`, `fund_amount`, `lp_payout`,
  etc.) are `i128` in the token's native unit (stroops); format using the
  token's configured decimals for display.
* **Cross-contract correlation**: `iln_distribution`'s `LpVolumeAccrued`/
  `SettlementAccrued` events correlate with `invoice_liquidity`'s
  `InvoiceFunded`/`InvoicePaid` events (same ledger, triggered by the same
  underlying call), but carry no shared invoice id — indexers should
  correlate by ledger sequence + participant address if they need to join
  the two streams.
