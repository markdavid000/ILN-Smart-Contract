#![no_std]

//! Default-protection insurance pool — stub implementation (Issue #123).
//!
//! Liquidity providers (LPs) optionally opt into this pool by paying premiums.
//! When an invoice they funded defaults, the pool compensates them out of the
//! accumulated premium balance (up to a flat per-claim coverage cap).
//!
//! This is a **design-forward stub**: it implements the full
//! [`InsurancePoolInterface`] with correct storage, auth, events and accounting
//! semantics, but deliberately keeps the economics simple:
//!   * Premiums are tracked as pool *accounting* balance rather than via an
//!     actual token transfer (token settlement is a follow-up).
//!   * Compensation is a flat per-claim cap configured at init, not a
//!     risk-priced payout.
//!
//! See `docs/insurance-pool-design.md` for the integration design and the
//! follow-up work needed before mainnet.
